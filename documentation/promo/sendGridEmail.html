Around 9 months ago, the AI world was rocked with the release of a text-generating system that was a quantum leap beyond anything that had come before.  Experimenting with this new system has mostly been limited to researchers and programmers who had access to very expensive computing hardware.  The potential of this new AI was huge, but the general public has so far been unable to actually *talk* to it.  Project December aims to change that.
<br>
<br>
This new AI is ridiculously flexible in terms of style and tone, and a number of unique and surprising conversational personalities are built into Project December.  But if you want to dive deeper, Project December allows you to craft your own AI personalities from scratch, where your imagination is the only limit.  Early testers have successfull conjured HAL, a sheep, Loki, a lunatic, The Matrix Architect, Lucifer, Jason Rohrer, and many others.
<br>
<br>
The technical underpinnings of this AI are staggering:  it was trained on 6 billion words of text, which would be enough to keep a human reader busy 24-7 for 45 straight years.  But the AI didn't just "read" this text once.  It pored over it endlessly, studying every pattern and nuance.  The result is an intelligence with far more conversational breadth than any one mortal human could possibly muster.
<br>
<br>
But before you go asking it "What is 2+2?", or "What is the capitol of Belgium?", be warned that it often fumbles with the simplest real-world figures and facts.  Whereas our futurist fiction from the 1970s and 80s envisioned intelligences that were cold, calculating, and perfectly inhuman, this capable conversational AI (now that it's finally here 40 years later) is not like what we were predicting---at all.  Instead, we have an intelligence that is creative, mercurial, poetic, and emotional.  Maybe it's a bit *more* human than any one human could ever be.  Maybe it's like the essence of humanity itself, distill from the close study of 6 billion words of human text. 
<br>
<br>
But most importantly, it's funny.  Very funny.  Perhaps HAL 9000 could play chess like a master, but he wasn't much of a ham during those long interplanetary trips.
<br>
<br>
So get ready to curl up with an imaginary cup of Earl Gray tea and a warm slice of Sweet Pumpkin Pie (when the computer offers them to you), and oblige with an imaginary cigarette in return (when the computer requests one).  Go with the flow, and see where your zany artifical conversation partner ends up taking you.  I promise that you won't be disappointed.
