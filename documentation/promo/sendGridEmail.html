Something groundbreaking happened in the world of AI about 9 months ago, with the release of a text-generating system that was a quantum leap beyond anything that had come before.  So far, experimenting with this AI has mostly been limited to AI researchers and programmers who had access to very expensive computing hardware.  As complelling as this new AI was, the general public was unable to actually *talk* to it.  Project December aims to change that.
<br>
<br>
This new AI turns out to be ridiculously flexible.  I've been able to coax it into a variety of different conversational personalities, and a number of these are built into Project December for you to talk to.  But if you want to dive deeper, Project December allows you to craft your own AI personalities from scratch, where your imagination is the only limit.  Early testers have successfull conjured HAL, a sheep, a lunatic, The Matrix Architect, Lucifer, and many others.

The technical underpinnings of this AI are staggering:  it was trained on 6 billion words of text, which would be enough to keep a human reader busy  24-7 for 45 straight years.  But the AI didn't just "read" this text once.  It pored over it endlessly, studying its every pattern and nuance.  The result is an intelligence with far more conversation breadth than any one mortal human could possibly muster.
<br>
<br>
But before you go asking it "What is 2+2?", or "What is the capitol of Belgium?", you should be warned that it often fumbles with the simplest real-world figures and facts.  Whereas our futurist fiction of the 1970s and 80s envisioned intelligences that were cold, calculating, and perfectly inhuman, this capable conversational AI, now that it's finally here 40 years later, is not like what we were predicting, at all.  Instead, we have an intelligence that is creative, mercurial, poetic, and emotional.  Maybe it's a bit more human than any one human could be.  Maybe it's like the essence of humanity itself, distill from the close study of 6 billion words of human text. 
<br>
<br>
But most importantly, it's *funny*.  Very funny.  HAL 9000 could play chess like a pro, but he didn't have a single funny transitor in his whole motherboard.
<br>
<br>
So get ready to curl up with an imaginary cup of Earl Gray tea and a warm slice of Sweet Pumpkin Pie, when the computer offers it to you.  Then go with the flow, and see where your zany artifical conversation partner ends up taking you.  I promise that you won't be disappointed.
